# Incorrect Quotes Bot
Hey there! My name is Slugcat, and I'm the developer for Incorrect Quotes Bot.
If you don't know who or what an Incorrect Quotes Bot is, it is a Discord bot using Discord.py, a Python library.
As a Discord bot approaching 100 servers, IQB needs verification, and a TOS must be made, so, here it is.

# What IQB is:
In the backend of things, Incorrect Quotes Bot is a box of random that spits out a quote, with a character's name in it. You supply the names, Incorrect Quotes Bot generates a quote with those names.
IQB has support for:
- Saving those quotes as images (and images are not kept, sent once and then deleted)
- Saving those quotes as tags (up to 3)
- Shuffling names around (if more than 1 is provided)
- Generating new quotes from an existing quote
- Generating new quotes from a quote generated from an existing quote
- Recursion (not really!)

He's a very simple boy, with a very simple purpose: make some fun with Incorrect Quotes. That's all.

You're allowed to:
- Share images made with IQB.
- Share tags with quotes made by IQB.
- Literally do anything with the quotes generated. It's all text, after all. Well, most of the time.
- Add IQB to your own server.
- Add IQB to a friend's server, if you have permission.
- ...Really, he's simple. Whatever you can do with him, you're allowed to do it.

# What is saved:
IQB needs to save a few things in order to have tags work, and it's all things that can be readily taken from anyone. It's public information.

Your Discord user ID. This is kept whenever you make a tag.

Your Discord username. This is also kept whenever you make a tag.

...That's it. That's all that's kept. These are kept permanently, even if you remove IQB or block it. You can request to have your tags removed at any time, should something go wrong with saving in the support server.
